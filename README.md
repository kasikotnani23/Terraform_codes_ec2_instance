The folder structure of terraform-codes-ec2-instance includes a main file and a module folder. The main file allows users to leverage the files in the modules folder without writing the entire code for creating an EC2 instance, as it already contains all the necessary details such as AMI, subnet, key name, and security group.

here their is an additional file as we don't need to use it in modules but we can use it in a different approach because we wwrote that code like that and it is not good for a moduler approach.
